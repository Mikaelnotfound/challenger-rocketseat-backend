# Rocketseat Challenge: Node.js & TypeScript Backend

![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-in%20progress-blue)

This project is a backend application developed as part of a Rocketseat challenge. The primary goal is to learn and apply modern technologies and trends in the Node.js and TypeScript development ecosystem.

## Technologies Used

*   **Node.js:** A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
*   **TypeScript:** A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
*   **Fastify:** A fast and low overhead web framework, for Node.js.
*   **tsx:** A CLI tool for seamlessly running TypeScript and ESM.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to have Node.js and npm (or another package manager) installed on your machine.
*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    https://github.com/Mikaelnotfound/challenger-rocketseat-backend.git
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Application

To start the development server with live-reloading, run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The server will start, and you can access it at the configured address (typically `http://localhost:3000` or similar).
